    "#### Why Take the Log of the Price?\n",
    "\n",
    "We take the logarithm of the price (outcome variable) because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: The coefficient estimates can be interpreted as percentage changes rather than absolute changes. This is particularly useful when analyzing price effects, as percentage changes are more intuitive in economic contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduces Skewness**: Prices often have a right-skewed distribution, meaning there are a few very high values that could disproportionately influence the regression results. Taking the log helps make the distribution more normal, which improves the reliability of the statistical model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stabilizes Variance**: Log transformation can help reduce heteroskedasticity, meaning it makes the variance of the residuals more constant across different levels of the independent variables, which is an assumption of OLS regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Better Fit for Multiplicative Relationships**: Many economic relationships are multiplicative rather than additive (e.g., a 10% increase in demand leads to a 5% increase in price, rather than a fixed amount). A log-linear model captures these effects better than a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying the log transformation, we ensure that our estimates reflect relative price changes, improving both the robustness and interpretability of our regression results."

    "\n",
    "- **R-squared (0.408):** The model explains about 40.8% of the variance in log-transformed hotel prices. While this is a reasonable fit, it suggests that other factors influence prices beyond our current variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **During_Treatment (-0.0541, p = 0.059):** There is a small negative effect of the treatment period on prices, but it is not statistically significant at the 5% level. This suggests that, in general, prices may not have dropped significantly in the post-event period across both cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Barcelona (-0.0356, p = 0.234):** The coefficient is negative but not statistically significant, indicating that, after controlling for treatment timing, baseline hotel prices in Barcelona do not differ significantly from those in Madrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interaction Term (Barcelona × Treatment: 0.8597, p < 0.001):** This is the most relevant coefficient for our Difference-in-Differences analysis. The highly significant and large positive effect suggests that hotel prices in Barcelona **increased** significantly during the Mobile World Congress, relative to Madrid. This confirms a strong event effect."

    "#### Potential Controls:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hotel Rating:** Higher-rated hotels tend to have higher prices, as positive reviews often signal better quality, amenities, and service. Including this as a control helps account for differences in pricing due to customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of Stars:** The official star rating of a hotel (e.g., 3-star, 4-star, 5-star) is a strong determinant of price. More luxurious hotels generally charge higher prices, so including this variable helps isolate the effect of the event from differences in accommodation quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of Comments:** Hotels with a higher number of reviews might have different pricing strategies. A well-reviewed hotel may charge premium prices due to its established reputation, while a newer or less-reviewed hotel may offer lower prices to attract customers. Controlling for this helps adjust for differences in consumer demand based on past guest experiences.\n",

    "- **Event Effect (Barcelona × Treatment: 0.8598, p < 0.001):**  \n",
    "  The strong and highly significant positive coefficient confirms that hotel prices in Barcelona increased significantly during the Mobile World Congress, compared to Madrid. This provides strong evidence that the event had a substantial impact on hotel prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **During_Treatment (-0.0542, p = 0.021):**  \n",
    "  Prices generally declined slightly during the treatment period across both cities. However, this effect is relatively small and only marginally significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Barcelona (-0.1359, p < 0.001):**  \n",
    "  On average, hotels in Barcelona tend to have lower prices compared to Madrid, after controlling for other factors. This could be due to differences in market structure, competition, or supply constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hotel Characteristics Matter:**  \n",
    "  - **Rating (0.0939, p < 0.001):** Higher-rated hotels tend to have significantly higher prices.  \n",
    "  - **Stars (0.2383, p < 0.001):** The number of stars is a strong predictor of price, with higher-star hotels charging more.  \n",

    "## (b) Text Features as Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorporating text-based features from hotel descriptions allows us to capture additional factors that might influence hotel prices. Below are key text-derived variables that can serve as controls in our analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Special Mentions:** The number of times key location-based words appear in the description (e.g., \"centro\", \"playa\", \"aeropuerto\", \"wifi\", \"metro\", \"piscina\"). These terms indicate proximity to important landmarks or services that could drive up hotel prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentiment Score:** A numerical measure of the overall tone of the hotel description, capturing whether the description is more positive, neutral, or negative. More positive descriptions might correlate with higher prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Luxury Score:** The count of words associated with luxury (e.g., \"spa\", \"lujoso\", \"exclusivo\", \"premium\", \"sofisticado\", \"personalizado\", \"masajes\", \"sauna\"). Hotels emphasizing luxury features in their descriptions are likely to have higher prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mentions of Key Amenities:** Some amenities, such as \"wifi\" or \"piscina\", could impact pricing. Hotels highlighting more amenities may justify higher prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentence Count:** A measure of the length of the description, which could serve as a proxy for how much information is provided about the hotel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Word Count:** Longer descriptions might indicate better marketing efforts, higher-end accommodations, or more comprehensive information. This could act as a proxy for hotel reputation and demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating these text-based features into our regression model, we can better control for qualitative aspects of hotel listings that could affect price differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, words like \"Barcelona\" would not help because they appear in almost every description for accommodations in Barcelona and could only serve to distinguish the treatment and control groups, rather than providing meaningful variation within the treatment group. Including such a term in the regression would not add explanatory power, as it would be highly collinear with the city dummy variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, since \"Barcelona\" is already accounted for in the fixed effects or city dummy, its presence in the text does not provide additional information about hotel characteristics, amenities, or price determinants. Instead, we should focus on words that differentiate hotels based on location, quality, or services offered."

    "#### Key Takeaways from Heterogeneous Treatment Analysis Based on Hotel Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overall Model Fit**:  \n",
    "  - The model explains **61.4%** of the variance in log hotel prices (**R² = 0.614**), which is a significant improvement from previous models.  \n",
    "  - This suggests that incorporating hotel quality characteristics enhances explanatory power.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Main Treatment Effect**:  \n",
    "  - The **During_Treatment** coefficient is **-0.3829 (p = 0.017)**, indicating that prices generally decrease outside the event period.  \n",
    "  - The **Barcelona_x_Treatment** coefficient remains strong and positive (**0.8516, p < 0.001**), confirming that hotel prices in **Barcelona increased significantly** during the **Mobile World Congress (MWC)** compared to Madrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hotel Characteristics & Price Levels**:  \n",
    "  - **Higher ratings and more stars significantly increase hotel prices**:  \n",
    "    - **Rating**: **0.0828 (p < 0.001)** → Higher-rated hotels tend to have higher prices.  \n",
    "    - **Stars**: **0.2216 (p < 0.001)** → More stars strongly correlate with higher prices.  \n",
    "  - **Number of reviews has a small but positive effect** (**p = 0.028**), suggesting that more reviewed hotels tend to have slightly higher prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (Interaction Terms)**:  \n",
    "  - **During_Treatment × Rating (0.0311, p = 0.144)**:  \n",
    "    - The coefficient is **positive but not statistically significant**, meaning we do **not** find strong evidence that **higher-rated hotels reacted differently** to MWC in terms of price increases.  \n",
    "  - **During_Treatment × Stars (0.0203, p = 0.387)**:  \n",
    "    - The effect of **stars on price changes** during the event is **also not significant**, suggesting that **luxury hotels did not systematically increase their prices more than lower-tier hotels**.  \n",
    "  - **During_Treatment × Luxury_Score (0.0300, p = 0.212)**:  \n",
    "    - The **luxury score does not significantly moderate the treatment effect**, indicating that explicitly “luxury-marketed” hotels **did not price differently** due to MWC.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conclusion**:  \n",
    "  - The event had a **substantial price effect overall**, particularly in **Barcelona**.  \n",
    "  - However, we do **not find strong evidence that higher-end hotels** (luxury, more stars, or higher ratings) **systematically increased their prices more than lower-end hotels** during the event.  \n",
    "  - This could suggest that **MWC affects all hotels similarly**, rather than having a **disproportionate effect on high-end accommodations**."
